# Sparql Playground

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/calipho-sib/sparql-playground.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/calipho-sib/sparql-playground)

SPARQL playground is a standalone multi-platform web application used to learn SPARQL (implemented in Java Spring Boot and AngularJS). 

It uses Sesame 2.7.9 as SPARQL Engine. 

It is beeing developed at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.isb-sib.ch/">SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics</a>.  

You can see a live demo here: http://sparql-playground.isb-sib.ch/

You can also see a live version of nextprot samples here: http://sparql-playground.nextprot.org/


##Installation
* Download the [latest release](https://github.com/calipho-sib/sparql-playground/tarball/master)
* Unzip the folder and run the start script (start.bat for windows users or start.sh for unix users) (it requires java 1.7 or higher)
* Once the application started you should open your browser on: <a href="http://localhost:8888" target="_blank">http://localhost:8888</a>

* Select the examples and click on the GO button

##Predefined RDF scenarios / datasets

There are some scenarios predefined:

* Default scenario comes with less than 100 triplets and does not require any domain knowledge (persons and their pets)

* neXtProt helps you understand the neXtProt rdf model (run the start-nextprot script)

##Create your own RDF scenario (no programming skills are required) 

* You can create your own scenario by giving a directory as argument: `java -jar sparql-playgroud.war your-directory-name`

Your directory should follow this convention:

* ttl-data: a folder containing turtle file(s)
* queries: a folder containing the queries showed in the first page 
* prefixes.ttl: a file containing the default prefixes (optional) to be added to queries
* pages: pages with markdown files for the Documentation tab
* config.properties - optionally you can include this property file with: repository.type=native to create a native repository (instead of in memory). This is particulary useful if your dataset contains more than 100'000 triplets

If you like you can share your dataset with us.

##Technology in use
* The SPARQL engine is Sesame 2.7.9
* The backend uses Spring Boot 1.2.3
* The frontend is build with angularJS 1.3 and bootstrap 3
* Requires Java 1.7 or higher
