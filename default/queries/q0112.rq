#title:Get a subset of the class and instance pairs (subjects and objects connected with rdf:type) in the dataset - only the 5 solutions following the 3 first ones (?class ?instance pairs) of the full set ordered by ?class and ?instance 
#comment:The OFFSET modifier causes the 3 first solutions not to be returned
#comment:The LIMIT modifier sets the upper bound (5here 5) to the number of solutions returned. 
#comment:The first solution returned is the one at rank 4 of the full set, just after the offset value 
#comment:The ORDER BY clause is applied on the full set of solutions. The LIMIT and the OFFSET modifiers are
#comment:applied after the set of solutions is ordered by ORDER BY clause.
#comment:OFFSET and LIMIT, used together with an ORDER BY clause can be used for paging of results.
